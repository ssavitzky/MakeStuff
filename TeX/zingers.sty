%%% zingers.sty - the group's singer annotations.
%%%
%%% This style is meant to be overridden by one in the Lyrics directory.
%%% It can also be used to define other local information.  In particular,
%%% it is typically used to define the footers for song pages.  Otherwise
%%% they come out very generic.

%%% For example:

\def\A:{{\tt ALL:\ }}
\def\N:{{\tt \ \ N:\ }}
\def\S:{{\tt \ \ S:\ }}
\def\NS:{{\tt \ NS:\ }}

%%%   Definitions can be overridden in zongbook.tex, so you can have different
%%%   footers or headers for individual song pages and the songbook.
