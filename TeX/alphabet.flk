        [C]A is for ASCII, our [G]Alphabet's [C]name
        [C]B is the Bugs, for which [G7]we get the blame.
        [C]C the Computer, which [F]never works [C]right, and
        [C]D is Debugging, the [G7]rest of the [C]night.
\begin{refrain}
            [C]Programming, programming, [G7]all through the [C]night,
            [C]We're stuck here until our new [G7]program works right.
            [C]Programming, programming, [F]aren't {\em italics [C]fun?}
            [C]The maintainance starts when deb[G7]ugging is [C]done!
\end{refrain}
        E is the Elegant problems we're set \spoken{e.g. TeX comments, % like this one
	which eat the linefeed}
        F is old Fortran we try to Forget.
        G is the GOTO we're trying to kill, and
        H is the Hacker who uses it still.

\begin{chorus} % a chorus is just like a refrain.  The line break is eaten too.

            [C]Programming, programming, [G7]all through the [C]night,
            [C]We're stuck here until our new [G7]program works right.
            [C]Programming, programming, [F]isn't it [C]fun?
            [C]The maintainance starts when deb[G7]ugging is [C]done!
\end{chorus}
        I is the Input we handle with care
        J is the Jump to nobody knows where
        K is the Kludge with which we got by, and
        L is for Later to fix it we'll try.
\\
        M is the Memory, dropping a bit,
        N the New version, that doesn't quite fit.
        O is the Op'rating system we buy, and
        P is the Patch to make our programs fly.
\begin{bridge}
If this was a real song
This would be a bridge
But \spoken{this is a test % and this is a comment
 with a line break commented out}
\end{bridge}
        Q is for QWERTY, of typewriter lore,
        R is the RAM that we used to call core.
        S is the Standard we'll follow some day, and
        T is the Teletype, banging away.
\\
        U is the User, that Unhappy man,
        V is the Vengence he wreaks when he can.
        W is Work, it's the manager's call, and
        X is the Xerox machine down the hall.
\\
        Y is the Yes you reply by mistake, and
        Z is the Zeros all over your tape.
        There may be more verses they wanted to send,
        But they've all gotten clobbered, so this is the end.
