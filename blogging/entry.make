### MakeStuff plugin for making and posting blog entries.
#
# Usage:  include $(TOOLDIR)/blogging/entry.make

### Targets:
#	draft:	makes a draft entry in the top-level directory.  name-required
#	entry:	makes an entry directly in the destination directory.  symlinks .draft
#		to it so that you can post without specifying a name.  Typically used
#		when you are reasonably sure that you will be posting the same day.
#       post:	post an entry.  Define POSTCMD if you have your own posting client.
#		if name isn't defined, uses the link in .draft.
#
# Note: You can post an arbitrary file with make post ENTRY=<file>
#	A default name can be defined in .config.make and overridden on the command line.
#
# Tweakable Parameters:
#       DONT_COMMIT_DRAFT if defined, just add the draft without committing it.
#	POST_ARCHIVE 	- if defined, this is the path to yyyy/...; it must end in /
#		          Typically this will be ../ (slash required).  Defaults to .
#	DRAFTS	     	- if defined, directory where we keep drafts.  Used with Jekyll.
#	EXT	     	- Filename extension.  Default is html; md is a popular alternative.
#	PFX	     	- prepended to the template name.  See thanks.make for an example.

### Defaults

# The default default extension is html; this lets us override the default in .config.make
DEFAULT_EXT ?= html
POSTCMD	?= ljpost
#DONT_COMMIT_DRAFT = true

## figure out what the extension for posts should be.

  ifdef name
    # take the extension from the name, if it has one.
    ifneq "$(suffix $(name))" ""

  endif
endif
# if not passed in or taken from the name, use the default.
EXT ?= $(DEFAULT_EXT)

ifndef name			# if we don't have a name
  ifdef title			# but we do have a title, slugfy it.

  endif

## entry:  make an entry for today, and link .draft

#

## draft:  make a draft in the top level.
#	the .draft link isn't necessary, but we make one if it doesn't already exist
#	(which would indicate that there's some other draft in progress)
#	post with "make post name=<filename>"; name is required in this case

#	Multiple drafts can occur if drafts are kept in a separate directory;

# pre-post:  move the entry to the correct location (yyyy/mm/dd--name) if necessary
#	The entry is not committed; that's done in post, but if it hasn't been added
#	git mv will fail and we do a plain mv followed by git add.
#
#	Make a symlink from .post to the most recent entry, to make it easy to edit.
#	Done in pre-post so that you can separate the two steps to do something like
#	a word-count.  This works because pre-post is idempotent.
#
#	.draft stays around until you "make post" so that it won't require a name=
#	if you make pre-post separately, e.g. for word count.

### A little history:
#
#	This was derived from the depends.make -- formerly the Makefile -- in one
#	of my "private" journals.  Specifically, Private/Journals/River was one
#	of the two "journals" that were used primarily for Livejournal (later
#	Dreamwidth) entry drafts.
